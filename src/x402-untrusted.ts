// The untrusted-data fence — the SHARED format for surfacing seller-controlled
// text to a model.
//
// This lives in the SDK, dependency-free and browser-safe, so that every server
// that shows a model text written by a stranger renders it the same way: the
// payer MCP server here, and the facilitator's discovery MCP server. Two
// implementations of a security-relevant format drift, and the drift is
// invisible until something breaks out of a fence — so there is one
// implementation and one set of conformance vectors (./x402-untrusted-vectors).
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// WHAT THIS DOES AND DOES NOT DO — read before trusting it
//
//   The nonce makes the BOUNDARY unforgeable. A seller cannot close the fence,
//   because the terminator carries a value drawn after their text was in hand.
//
//   The sanitiser REMOVES DANGEROUS CONTENT: control characters, bidi overrides
//   and zero-width characters that can make a line read differently than it
//   displays.
//
//   NEITHER MAKES A MODEL OBEY THE INSTRUCTION. The fence is a CONVENTION. It
//   tells a model that the enclosed text is data; it cannot compel that model to
//   treat it as data. Whether any given model honours it is unverified here and
//   unverifiable from inside this module — it is a property of the model, not of
//   this code.
//
//   Do not treat a fenced block as a security boundary. It reduces the chance
//   that hostile text is READ as instructions; it does not prevent a model from
//   acting on it. The things that actually bound damage are elsewhere: the
//   per-call and per-session spend limits, and above all the chain-enforced
//   budget, which no amount of emitted text can exceed.
